# Composion

A component library made with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh).

## Rationale

My desire is to create a library that is **lighter** than Grommet and closer to the **Flexbox** specification than other libraries like Blueprint, PrimeReact, Rebass or Semantic UI.

The idea is that someone who knows the [Flexible Layout Box Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1) should **know how to use** the library and that someone who does not know Flex Boxes should be able to **learn by using it**.

I believe that a good library is a library that is **simple to teach**. But Flexbox is not always an easy concept. Composion, in addition to its implementation should provide documentation covering all the Flexbox properties and providing examples of the main use cases.

## Run examples

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`
yarn install
yarn start-storybook
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Getting started ðŸš€

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`
npx create-react-app composion-example
cd composion-example
yarn add composion @emotion/styled @emotion/react
`}
</CodeBlock>
