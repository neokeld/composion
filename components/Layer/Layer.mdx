# Layer

Presents content overlaid over other parts of the UI.

## align

Flex items in the Layer can be aligned in the cross axis of the current line of the flex container, similar to justify-content but in the perpendicular direction.

Values:
* `start`
    * The cross-start margin edge of the item is placed flush with the cross-start edge of the line. 
* `end`
    * The cross-end margin edge of the item is placed flush with the cross-end edge of the line. 
* `center`
    * The item’s margin box is centered in the cross axis within the line. (If the cross size of the flex line is less than that of the flex item, it will overflow equally in both directions.) 
* `baseline`
    * The item participates in baseline alignment: all participating flex items on the line are aligned such that their baselines align, and the item with the largest distance between its baseline and its cross-start margin edge is placed flush against the cross-start edge of the line. If the item does not have a baseline in the necessary axis, then one is synthesized from the flex item’s border box. 
* `stretch`
    * If the cross size property of the flex item computes to auto, and neither of the cross-axis margins are auto, the flex item is stretched. Its used value is the length necessary to make the cross size of the item’s margin box as close to the same size as the line as possible, while still respecting the constraints imposed by min-height/min-width/max-height/max-width.

## justify

The justify props aligns flex items in the Layer along the main axis of the current line of the flex container. This is done after any flexible lengths and any auto margins have been resolved. Typically it helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

Values:
* `start`
    * Items are packed toward the start of the line. The main-start margin edge of the first flex item on the line is placed flush with the main-start edge of the line, and each subsequent flex item is placed flush with the preceding item. 
* `end`
    * Items are packed toward the end of the line. The main-end margin edge of the last flex item is placed flush with the main-end edge of the line, and each preceding flex item is placed flush with the subsequent item. 
* `center`
    * Items are packed toward the center of the line. The flex items on the line are placed flush with each other and aligned in the center of the line, with equal amounts of space between the main-start edge of the line and the first item on the line and between the main-end edge of the line and the last item on the line. (If the leftover free-space is negative, the flex items will overflow equally in both directions.) 
* `space-between`
    * Items are evenly distributed in the line. If the leftover free-space is negative or there is only a single flex item on the line, this value is identical to flex-start. Otherwise, the main-start margin edge of the first flex item on the line is placed flush with the main-start edge of the line, the main-end margin edge of the last flex item on the line is placed flush with the main-end edge of the line, and the remaining flex items on the line are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent items is the same. 
* `space-around`
    * Items are evenly distributed in the line, with half-size spaces on either end. If the leftover free-space is negative or there is only a single flex item on the line, this value is identical to center. Otherwise, the flex items on the line are distributed such that the spacing between any two adjacent flex items on the line is the same, and the spacing between the first/last flex items and the flex container edges is half the size of the spacing between flex items. 
* `space-evenly`
    * Distribute items evenly. Items have equal space around them

## zIndex

An integer that determines at which level the Layer will be placed. Overlapping Layers with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.
